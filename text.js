    `<h1 style="font-family: ariel">Welcome to the Mishmash Companion Tool!</h1> 
     <p>New to Mishmash? Mishmash is a wacky "Cards Against Humanity" game that involves taking two Mishmash cards and mashing them 
      into a crazy new fusion, which you'll use to compete against other players by arguing how it best fulfills a certain condition
      â€” which itself is made from a fusion of two Condition cards, made by your Decision Masher!</p>
     <p>This website is an offline resource that allows you to play the game. Just pull up your favorite chat app, invite your 
      friends to a video call, get them to open the site themselves, and start playing!</p>
     <p>The buttons above will let you navigate through the website. "How to Play" will show you the rules of the game and how to
      best use the companion tool, while "Create a Condition" and "Create a Mishmash" will respectively allow you to create Fusion
      Condition cards (which you are judged on) and Fusion Mishmash cards (the zany things you make for the condition).</p>`;

    `<h2>The Rules of the Game</h2> 
    <p>Welcome to the How to Play page. We'll explain how you can play Mishmash using this tool.</p>
    <p>Mishmash is a game that requires at least three players, and is best played with a max of six. To play, first invite some
     friends over, and join a video call on your favorite chat app! All of you will also want to open up this website to
     play the game.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>Each round, one of those players will be chosen to be the Decision Masher, who will create a Fusion Condition card. This 
     card determines what the condition is for a player to win. First, <b>choose your Decision Masher to begin the round.</b></p> 
    <p>At the start of the round, have your Decision Masher go to "Create a Condition". Once there, <b>he/she will announce the 
     condition prompt cards he/she has available</b> and show them via video sharing or by using a screenshot tool. Afterward, the
     Decision Masher will <b>choose two condition cards in secret</b> by using a dropdown menu, and then click the "Next" button.
     Based on the chosen prompts, he/she can then name the Fusion Condition card and give it a description that describes what 
     the condition exactly is, and how to fulfill it. Click "Next" again, and the Fusion Condition card will be displayed!</p>
    <p>At the same time, all other players will privately go to "Create a Mishmash" and, after seeing the condition cards
     the Decision Masher was given, <b>choose two mishmash cards</b> to use as prompts. They will then name their Fusion Mishmash card
     and give a description, explaining aspects of what the mishmash is like. Creating a Fusion Mishmash follows the same steps
     as creating a Fusion Condition.</p>
    <p>Once everyone has made their cards, <b>reveal them!</b> The Decision Masher first reveals the Fusion Condition (via video share 
     or screenshot), which will be used to judge the other players. Then, the rest of the group will each reveal their Fusion Mishmash.
     Once everyone has revealed their cards, the Decision Masher should give each player a chance to argue why their card best fits
     the condition placed by the Fusion Condition.</p>
    <p>Once everyone has had their turn, <b>the Decision Masher will decide who wins this round</b>. If you won, congrats! Next round,
     you will get to be the Decision Masher. Or, you and your group can choose someone else to take up the role.</p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <p>Here's a few extra notes that you should be aware of:<br/><br/></p>
        <li>Two different cards must be chosen. You cannot choose only one, nor choose the same prompt twice.</li>
        <li>Name and description have character limits of 64 and 320 characters each.</li>
        <li>Avoid leaving the card creation process until the round is over -- progress isn't saved, so you'll lose your prompts
         and your fusion card!</li>
        <li>Your fusion doesn't need to be a one-to-one match to your prompts! It simply needs to relate to it in some loose but
         understandable way.</li>
        <li>If your Fusion Mishmash isn't fitting enough for your prompts, the Decision Masher can disqualify you. If the Decision
         Masher's condition cards aren't fitting enough, the group can choose to disqualify the round and start a new one. Or
         just roll with the condition and let hilarity ensue!</li>
    </ul>
